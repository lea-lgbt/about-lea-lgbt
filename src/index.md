# Welcome to lea.lgbt

These are the about pages of [lea.lgbt](https://lea.lgbt), a mastodon instance.

## Why the name "lea.lgbt"?

The server is named after the admin, which is [Lea Rosema](https://lea.codes) (she/her). Maybe it is too much attribution to the admin of this instance. But on the other side, it embraces one idea of the fediverse: that the server is run by a random Lea, somewhere in Germany, and not by a company, nor by a billionaire.

Also, the server is primarily set up for my own social media account on the fediverse. Despite this, the instance is not running in single-user mode. If we know each other, you are welcome to request an invite.

I don't want to grow this instance too quickly as I want this instance to be a safe space. This requires proper moderation.
Being alone on this instance, I'm obliged to moderate myself, which is not optimal, if you see any content violating the rules, please don't hesitate to contact me and I will immediately address this.

## Attribution

This website is created with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) and [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/).

Additionally, it uses fluid typography auto-generated via [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi).

Kudos also go to Lene Saille and her [eleventy-excellent template](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent) where I shamelessly copycatted the way to organize the configuration inside a `/config` folder and encapsulating things into eleventy plugins, and also the method of building the CSS styles directly via Eleventy. 

## Financial support

No, I don't really need money right now. Before considering to financially support this fediverse instance, consider to financially support organizations and projects instead that support BIPoC and trans folks, fight against far-right extremism or help fighting climate change:

An excerpt of support-worthy organizations (in no way associated to [lea.lgbt](https://lea.lgbt)) are:

- [Trakine e.V.](https://www.trans-kinder-netz.de/wer-sind-wir.html)
- [Deutsche Gesellschaft für Transidentität und Intersexualität e.V.](https://dgti.org/)
- [EXIT Deutschland](https://www.exit-deutschland.de/spenden/)
- [Fridays For Future](https://fridaysforfuture.de/spenden/)
- [Queer Lexikon](https://queer-lexikon.net/)
- [Mermaids](https://mermaidsuk.org.uk/)
