# Welcome to lea.lgbt

This are the about pages of [lea.lgbt](https://lea.lgbt), a mastodon instance.

## Why the name "lea.lgbt"?

The server is named after the admin, which is [Lea Rosema](https://lea.codes). Maybe it is too much attribution to the admin of this instance. But on the other side, it embraces one idea of the fediverse: that the server is run by a random Lea, somewhere in Germany, and not by a company, nor by a billionaire.
