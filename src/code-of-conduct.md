### Automated accounts

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported by contacting the administrator (either by using the official report feature or via mail to `lea et lea.lgbt`, replace `et` with `@`). 

Violating the rules can get you banned from the instance. You will get a warning first unless there are evil intentions.

Additionally it is important to note that also the admin itself (me) is not safe from enforcement, although she is committed to behave well and to follow the rules.

Please report any behaviour that bothers you. Any report is kept confidential.

If you spot an issue in this Code of Conduct, please don't hesitate to contact me (via mail to `lea et lea.lgbt`, replace `et` with `@`).

As a privileged white, able-bodied trans person, I may not be aware of every kind of marginalization and may still have certain biases to unlearn. When you report an issue on this Code of Conduct, I will take it as a valuable feedback and address it as soon as possible.
