## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove or reject posts that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the administrator [lea@lea.lgbt](mailto:lea@lea.lgbt). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

Consequence: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. Also, a public apology and change/deletion of inappropriate content is
requested.

### 2. Permanent Ban

Community Impact: A violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

Consequence: A permanent ban from any sort of interaction or public communication within the community. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.
